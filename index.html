		<strong>Anyone can be a great artist with enough practice and determination!</strong>
		<p>There is a misconception that people are only born with artistic skills and it can't be taught to a professional level.  Like every other skill, practice will only make you better.</p>

	<p>Those are drawings I did years apart which shows some improvement on colors and realism.  I practiced for hours a week on coloring and accuracy just for the fun of it.  It's always satisfying to see finished results.</p>

		<h1>Example of a great website</h1>
			<p>An example of a great website that has a wide variety of art is <a href="https://www.deviantart.com">https://www.deviantart.com</a>.  The site is easy to navigate and user friendly.  It allows people to collaborate and share artwork.  Looking at the HTML elements, I see a lot of tags containing ID's and Classes.  I'm assuming those are for styling the websites better and also automation testing.</p>
